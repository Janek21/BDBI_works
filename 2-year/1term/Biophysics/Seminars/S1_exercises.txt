1.What is the role of entropy in the functioning of
an Stirling engine?

2. Do you think this engine can run forever from the
heat of a cup of hot water? Why?

3. If we put the engine in a very hot room, do you
think it will be able to run using the heat of a cup
of hot water? Why?

4. Do you think this engine can run using a source of
cold instead of a source of heat? Why?
